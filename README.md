# sop
# Full-fledged documentation coming very soon

## Introduction
`sop` is short for _Sector OPerations_.
It's an overengineered real mode x86 BIOS bootsector (<=510 bytes) that implements a fully-working command line.
`sop` is very flexible and easily hackable: you can make commands run at boot, add your own, and alter existing ones or extend internal behavior.

This terminal-like interface supports:
- Text-mode screen assertion
- ASCII-only BIOS keyboard
- Backspace
- Prompt loop
- One-way scrolling

Supported commands:
